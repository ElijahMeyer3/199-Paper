## Value 

Value: Demand for data science skillsets are inscreasing. As demand increases, class sizes to best prepare students with these skills are increasing as well. However, there is still debate over what modern data science curricula should look like. We present a flexiable framework that highlights our implementation of technical, pedagogical, and curriculur decisions within our Introductory to Data Science course at Duke University. 

Audience - new to teaching / teachers increasing course size / teachers wanting to "modernize" their course 

Goal: Draft out by early May 

Potential Journals: JSDSE or Harvard Data Science

# Maria Response to Kaplan Way 

I adopted this framework from Kristin Stephens-Martinez (https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ksm/), a PoP in CS, who has used it to structure some her of intro classes. I think she first heard about it from another intro CS professor at a different institution, so I was actually not aware this was the Kaplan method of teaching . I started using “prepare, practice, perform” for 199 and 210 during the pandemic when I used lecture videos and moved to a more flipped class format. I used this phrasing to help explain the order and purpose of the different course activities (lecture videos, AEs, labs, etc.). So I used the language to (hopefully) more clearly communicate all the moving pieces of the course to students, rather than referring to something specific in the Kaplan method. I would suggest focusing more on the each learning activity rather than the language itself, but you could mention it is the same language used in the Kaplan model.

## Document Name 

blueprint

## Bolded Text 

I have bolded text within the paper to highlight areas within that you (Mine) may be the more appropriate to write a couple sentences on. Further, I have outlined the section + topic below: 

Course 

-- student characteristic + demographic information 

Teaching Team 

-- Brief writing on TA selection process 

-- Brief writing on TA Training 

Setting Up R & R-Studio 

-- Brief writing on how Duke Container is prepared + managed 

-- Brief writing on Duke Container alternative (like R-studio cloud) <- I can also take a stab at this

Using R & R-Studio to Manage GitHub organization

-- Writing on gh_class package 

## Questions 

We define application exercise and STA199 early in the paper. Do we need to redefine them each section, or can AE and STA199 carry throughout the entire paper after being first defined?

Other questions specific to the paper are scattered in bold within the writing.
