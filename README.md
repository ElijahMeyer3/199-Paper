# Introductory Data Science: A Blueprint to Navigate Curricular, Pedagogical, and Computational Challenges

Value: Demand for data science skillsets are inscreasing. As demand increases, class sizes to best prepare students with these skills are increasing as well. However, there is still debate over what modern data science curricula should look like. We present a flexiable framework that highlights our implementation of technical, pedagogical, and curriculur decisions within our Introductory to Data Science course at Duke University. 

Audience - new to teaching / teachers increasing course size / teachers wanting to "modernize" their course 

Goal: Draft out by early May 

Potential Journals: JSDSE or Harvard Data Science
