# Introductory Data Science: A Blueprint to Navigate Curricular, Pedagogical, and Computational Challenges

Value: Demand for data science skillsets are inscreasing. As demand increases, class sizes to best prepare students with these skills are increasing as well. However, there is still debate over what modern data science curricula should look like. We present a flexiable framework that highlights our implementation of technical, pedagogical, and curriculur decisions within our Introductory to Data Science course at Duke University. 

Audience - new to teaching / teachers increasing course size / teachers wanting to "modernize" their course 

Goal: Draft out by early May 

Potential Journals: JSDSE or Harvard Data Science

## Bolded Text:

I have bolded text within the paper to highlight areas within that you (Mine) may be the more appropriate to write a couple sentences on. Further, I have outlined the section + topic below: 

Course 

-- student characteristic + demographic information 

Teaching Team 

-- Brief writing on TA selection process 

-- Brief writing on TA Training 

Setting Up R & R-Studio 

-- Brief writing on how Duke Container is prepared + managed 

-- Brief writing on Duke Container alternative (like R-studio cloud) <- I can also take a stab at this

Using R & R-Studio to Manage GitHub organization

-- Writing on gh_class package 

## Questions 

We define application exercise and STA199 early in the paper. Do we need to redefine them each section, or can AE and STA199 carry throughout the entire paper after being first defined?

Other questions specific to the paper are scattered in bold within the writing.
