## Audience

Audience - new to teaching / teachers increasing course size (mention this as a draw in because this is happening). This could be a hook.

I think this needs to be further brought out in the beginning of the intro when formalling writing....

-- **Why** we are writing this paper

There is a demand for data scientists. An estimated 11.5 million new data science jobs are projected to be created by 2026, while employment of data scientists is projected to grow by 36 percent from 2021 to 2031 [@labor_2022]. **As demand increases, class sizes to best prepare students for these positions increases as well**. The increasing volume of enrollment of data science students [@Redmond2022] requires that statistics and data science educators commit to developing modern curriculum in order to help students be successful. Despite the demand, colleges are still struggling with what a modern data science curriculum should look like [@Schwab2020], and how it can be effectively taught to a large student audience. To this point, much more thought, work, and discussions need to take place there before a consensus is reached on what should a modern data science curricula should be.

**What people have been investigating / what's recommended**

Curricular

-   Intro to Data Science implementation [@Asamoah2015]

-   Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science [@veaux_2017]

-   50 Years of Data Science [@Donoho_2017]

-   Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Education Council [@Danyluk_2021]

-   Computational and Tech recommendations in curricula [@Donoho_2017; @Beckman_2021]


-   Active Learning / Other recommendations [@Dogucu_2022; @CetinkayaRundel_2022] + GAISE (Carver, 2016); Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences, 2016).


**But...**

However, the majority of context across the landscape of data science curricula largely focuses on how to model data [@Donoho2017]. This, in combination when a lack of consensus on what constitutes a data science curricula, and even less research on how to develop modern data science course presents a need for a blueprint to design and implement and modernized introduction to data science course. 

**So**

The need for those who can make meaning of data are clear. Thus, it is critical that data science education provides programs that adequately prepare and train students in the field of data science. This article adds to the existing literature by describing a modernized introductory data science course and how its taught, at Duke University.

The purpose of this paper is to offer valuable structure, while providing experiences from our perspective. It is of importance that we stress the amount of flexibility and strength in individuality in all aspects when creating, designing, and implementing an introductory data science course. (I don't know where this goes yet; Mine brings up a good point to make sure this is somewhere highlighted at the forefront)

In this paper, we discuss the integration of technology in our Introductory to Data Science course, and how these choices have helped shape our curricular and pedagogical decisions made. This includes detailing the implementation of the Kaplan Way learning model, to support a large class of students with a diverse background in statistics, data science, and coding experience. Within this format, we provide examples of and describe activities and assessments given both in and outside of class. We extend discussions and provide recommendations for implementing and integrating computing tools, such as R-studio and GitHub, through our experiences in our course. Lastly, we discuss challenges, and provide insight to help faculty wanting to adopt or adapt a course similar to introductory to data science at Duke University. The purpose of this paper is to continue the discussion, and present a modernized curricula for an introductory data science course at Duke University, and the pedagogical decisions to help best equip students with the data science skills necessary for future classes.

## The Course {#sec-course}

Reader should want to continue reading by thinking "this is something that I would like to teach"

In the following sections, we describe our introductory data science course offered to predominantly freshman level students at Duke University called Introduction to Data Science and Statistical Thinking (STA199). Often, these students are (interested in / major + minor in). Students enrolling in STA199 typically have little to no statistics, data science, or coding experience. In a typical semester, this course seats roughly 179 students, which is considered to be large by all measures. These factors are two common hurdles identified by faculty when trying to implement a data science course [@Schwab2020; @Kok_2008]. However, by the end of our course, students are able to use data to understand natural phenomena, investigate patterns, model outcomes, and make predictions. \\

This course is built on four large-scale learning objectives: learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a reproducible and shareable manner; gain experience in data wrangling and munging, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization; work on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions and data; learn to effectively communicate results through written assignments and project presentation. These objectives are accomplished through interactive lectures and labs that present content, problems, and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions and data. A typical week consists of two lectures and one lab section. During these times, students both learn and use the statistical software R, R-studio, and GitHub to visualize and analyze data in a reproducible and share able manner.

When teaching, instructors are committed to the Kaplan Way learning model "that combines a scientific, evidence-based design philosophy with a straightforward educational approach to learning" [@schweser_2023, pg. 3]. This model is composed of three phases: prepare, practice, and perform. All three phases are designed to guide the instructor in facilitating an overall quality learning experience for the student. During the prepare phases, students are completing readings, watching videos, and listening to lecture that ultimately builds upon a new foundation of new data science concepts being learned. The goal of preparing students is to put them in a position where they can build upon what they are learning, and create new knowledge through the practice phase. The practice phase is designed to be an opportunity for students to reinforce the new information gained, as well as uncover new conepts in data science. This is achieved through the use of interactive AEs in class where students work alone, in groups, or with the instructor in live coding sessions. Finally, students enter the perform phase to show their progress made in the previous two phases. This is typically done through assessments such as homework, exams, and projects. Additionally, students perform individually, or with a group, during weekly labs that tend to focus more on computation. This learning model is a continuous cycle throughout the semester as new topics are introduced.  

[insert Kaplan image here]

Topics taught in STA199 fall under two major units: Unit 1 - Exploring data; Unit 2 - Making rigorous conclusions. In Unit 1, students become first introduced to R, R-studio, and Github. During this unit, students start to create data visualizations and learn how to both import and manipulate data to be better suited for analysis. In unit 2, students extend their investigations with data to include modeling. Specifically, students fit a variety of models (simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression), and learn the fundementals of hypothesis testing. For a more complete description about the topics taught and data sets used in creating these lessons, please see **A fresh look at introductory data science (cite)**. 

In this paper, we describe the implementation process of STA199 in its entirety. This includes details of the teaching team used to instruct STA199, technology chosen to use when creating and facilitating our introductory data science course, and the pedagogical choices that go into a typical week of teaching. This includes a comprehensive description of a framework on how to create, set up, and implement an introduction to data science course similar to STA199.  


## Teaching Team

Typically, STA199 has a team of teaching assistants (TAs) in place to both support the instructor in charge of the class, and support the students in the classroom. These TAs range from undergraduate to PH.D. level students and vary in teaching experience. All teaching TAs go through a (insert writing about pre-semester training).


Then, students are assigned roles that indicate their responsibilities during the semester. These roles include *course organizer*, *head TA*, *lab leader*, and *lab helper*. Often, these roles are given based on the level of student, with more academically experienced TAs taking on the roles of course organizer, head TA, and lab leader, where as students with less experience (i.e. undergraduate students) take on the role of lab helper. 

Lab sections are often held once a week, and are facilitated in person by both a lab leader and lab helper. The responsibilities of a lab helper include supporting both the students and lab leader and they see fit. Examples of this may include setting up the classroom before class, or conducting small group conversations when students have questions about the material. The lab leader is responsible for facilitating the lab. This includes working through a pre-made lab to ensure they can help students apply concepts discussed in lecture. Both must hold two hours of office hours each week and have grading responsibilities assigned throughout the semester.  

Head TA responsibilities can generally be categorized as one of the following: Administrative or Pedagogical. Administrative responsibilities include the organization and distribution of TA responsibilities throughout the semester. It is imperative that the head TA and instructor clearly communicate expectations with each other to establish exactly how rules and responsibilities that are given to the TAs are assigned.  Administrative duties include reminding other TAs about bi-weekly payroll deadlines and ensure TAs are working their alloted hours per week (and not more). Within these alloted hours, a head TA distributes grading assignments and deadlines to both lab helpers and leaders per week. They make sure all TAs complete grading within a week and spot check the grading accuracy and quality of all written feedback given. (insert 1-2 sentences about experience). Pedagogically, head TAs are responsible for creating or reviewing answer keys and grading rubrics for homework and lab assessments as the instructor sees fit. Each head TA is also assigned to instructe one lab section during the semester. Before becoming a Head TA, there are additional 

The course organizer is expected to work across each section of STA199, instead of working with a single instructor. Their responsibilities include creating rubrics for and working through homework and lab assignments. Additionally the course organizer, along with the instructor, answers real time questions virtually during labs from lab leaders. Questions often range from content related to technical questions about GitHub and R. Finally, the course organizer is responsible for handling all requested assignment extension requests from students. This includes filing away student exemptions, providing extensions for extreme circumstances, and enforcing the late work policy outlined in the syllabus when necessary. 

Through my experience as an instructor working with this designed team, it is imperative that everyone is communicating with each other. A team with many different roles poses risk for the instructor to be unaware of how or what decisions are being enacted at the grading and lab levels of the course. Thus, it is recommended that the instructor trains everyone on the teaching team to use a communication system that allows every member to communicate any questions they may have, or decisions they make to the entire team. In the past, we have used the software *Slack*, with appropriately named channels such as *grading-questions* where TAs can post examples and questions about grading and the instructor can clearly state their expectations. Further, it should be noted that the head TA should not be treated as a "bridge of communication" for the instructor to the rest of the teaching team. It is critical that that the instructor is in consistent contact with all members of the teaching team in making sure all lab leaders and helpers understand the course content, upcoming assignments, and know what's expected of them in their assigned role. We recommend holding a weekly meeting with all members of the teaching team to ensure this. When members are unable to come, it is an expectation that they watch a recorded video of the meeting and reach out if they have any questions about what was discussed.

## Technology {#sec-tech}

Reader should want to continue reading by thinking "so how do I use this"

Next, we discuss our choices of technology.....

-   Github: Why version control; what it is; how we use it at the beginnings of the course

-- Collecting student information

-- Setting up a GitHub organization

-   R & R-studio; Why; what is is; how students get set up with it

-- Creating Duke Containers

(Mention alternative R-studio Cloud in discussion?)

Each of these types of technology aids in the creation and implementation our data science pedagogy. This includes in-class application exercise (AEs), lectures, labs, and assessments within the Kaplan model of learning.

## Pedagogy {#sec-ped}

-- Reader should want to continue reading by thinking "so how do I teach this"

In this course, we have chosen a combination of teaching methods, interactive activities, and learning assessments to help best prepare introductory data science students the tools they need to be successful outside of university or in future coursework. Our pedagogy includes facilitating in-class AEs, facilitating lectures, running a Lab, and assigning assessments to provide students an opportunity to show what they've learned.

### Application Exercies (AEs)

A majority of the time in class will be dedicated to working on AEs. These exercises are live-coding opportunities to practice applying data science concepts and code introduced through preparation materials. AEs are no-stakes assessments, often graded on completion, where students have the ability to write and edit code while asking questions at the student or class level and receive immediate feedback.

-- How GitHub and R are used to create AEs for students

It is up to the discretion of the instructor on the content that goes into the AEs. This can include having students write code themselves, fill in the blank coding exercises, commenting on complete code, or a combination of such questions.

-- Kaplan Way (Practice) / Active learning implementation of AEs (typical class day strategies / discussion)

### Lecture

A typical week yields 75-minute lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays. These lectures take up part of the class time, and are designed to introduce new concepts or review topics from the preparation videos in a more traditional format.

-- Creating slides using Quarto in R (?)

-- Kaplan Way (Prepare) / Active learning implementation during lecture (typical class day strategies / discussion)

Lectures are recorded and made available to students with an excused absence upon request.

### Labs

-- apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation

-- Individual and team based

-- Repo creation

-- Kaplan Way (Perform) (typical class day strategies / discussion)

### Assessments
